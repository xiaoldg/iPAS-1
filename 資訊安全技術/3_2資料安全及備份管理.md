### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
```
Data loss prevention (DLP) is both a company policy and a product available on the technology
market. As a company policy, DLP focuses on implementing defenses against data loss
and theft. As a product, DLP is a technology solution that can assist with the fulfillment of a
company’s DLP policy.
